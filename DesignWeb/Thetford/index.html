            <h1>The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</h1>

                Alcohol may be man's worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.
                I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.
                May you live to be 100 and may the last voice you hear be mine.
                Cock your hat - angles are attitudes.
                Basically, I'm for anything that gets you through the night - be it prayer, tranquilizers or a bottle of Jack Daniels.
                You gotta love livin', baby, 'cause dyin' is a pain in the ass.
                I like intelligent women. When you go out, it shouldn't be a staring contest.
                Hell hath no fury like a hustler with a literary agent.
